# Angular Static


`http://localhost:4200/`


`ng serve` to launch dev server   




we're using SCULLY to generate the static HTML files from our angular site - https://github.com/scullyio/scully   

  
`npm run scully -- --scanRoutes` to generate static site

to test new static site: 

`npm run scully:serve` - this will launch a simple local server at "http://localhost:1668/"



TODO...

solve how to have scully just pull a local file for the routes
